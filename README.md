# The Park and Tilford

This is a web site for a co-op in Manhattan. Nothing special, just relates the history of the building and provides a contact page.

**Live:** https://theparkandtilford.netlify.app/#

## How it's made

The site uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Optimizations

Maybe a directory of residents would be cool, or a more up-to-date information on the current residents.

## Lessons learned

This uses an old version of font awesome, which still works, but font awesome packs are more individualized now.

## Troubleshooting

I had some trouble getting the CSS right and added a secondary image class that would take a picture of any size and center it, instead of having it be cut correctly from the start.
